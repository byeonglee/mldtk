In order to generte a preprocessed version of the linux kernel 
(ver 2.6 at least) you need to make a modification to scripts/Makefile.build 
in the kernel source tree.  At approximately line 129 there is the rule:
define rule_cc_o_c  

add the following line as the first line of the rule:
$(CC) $(c_flags) -E -o $@.E $< ;  \

That will make all the object files needed for the kernel (based on .config)
and also make files named .o.E which are the preprocessed output.  

If you want to preprocesses "all" the files in the tree than run 
'make config' and just select Y to everything.  This won't get all the 
files since there are lots of either/or things but it gets the ones that
aren't.  Warning doing this will take 10+ hours on a 3.0 ghz machine 
with 1 gig of ram and consume ~3 gig of disk.
