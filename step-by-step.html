<h1>xtc Installation Notes</h1>

<p>This page provides step-by-step instructions for intalling xtc's
source release.  <a href="development">A separate page</a> provides
the reference for xtc's development setup.</p>

<!-- ================================================================== -->

<h2 class="highlight" id="steps">Step by Step</h2>

<p>Remember to fix any errors <em>before</em> moving on to the next
step.</p>

<ol class="spacious">

<li>Be sure that you are running
the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html">bash</a>
shell.  It is the default interactive shell on both Mac OS and
Linux.</li>

<li>Install all necessary Unix command line tools
(including <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">make</a>), the
Java Development Kit (JDK), and
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/dejagnu/">DejaGnu</a>:

<ul class="spacious">

<li>On Linux, these tools need to be installed individually and you
probably want to use a package manager.  For example, when using the
Ubuntu distribution of Linux, you can install all necessary tools by
executing the following two commands:
<pre>
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential openjdk-6-jdk dejagnu
</pre>
The first command updates APT's package index, and the second command
installs the <code>build-essential</code>, <code>openjdk-6-jdk</code>,
and <code>dejagnu</code> packages as well as their dependencies.
Since these commands change your system's configuration, you will need
to provide your superuser password.</li>

<li>On Mac OS X, necessary Unix command line tools and the JDK are
automatically installed with Apple's
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/xcode/">XCode</a> IDE.  However,
after installing XCode, you still need to install DejaGnu.  First,
download its source distribution.  Second, in the root directory of
the source distribution, execute the following three commands (which
are the customary incantations for installing all GNU software):
<pre>
./configure
make
sudo make install
</pre>
The first command determines your system's tools and configuration.
The second command builds the binaries.  The third command moves the
binaries in the right location.  Since the last command changes your
system's configuration, you will need to provide your administrator
password.</li>

</ul></li>

<li>Download xtc:

<ul>

<li>Download
xtc's <a href="http://cs.nyu.edu/rgrimm/xtc/xtc-core.zip">source
distribution</a> and place the directory in a convenient location.</li>

<li>Download
xtc's <a href="http://cs.nyu.edu/rgrimm/xtc/xtc-testsuite.zip">test
suite</a>.  Place the test suite's <code>data</code>
and <code>fonda</code> directories inside the <code>xtc</code>
directory contained in the source distribution.</li>

<li>Download
xtc's <a href="http://cs.nyu.edu/rgrimm/xtc/dependencies.zip">dependencies</a>
and place the JAR files contained in that ZIP file in xtc's <code>bin</code>
directory.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>Edit xtc's configuration script in <code>setup.sh</code>:

<ul>

<li><code>JAVA_DEV_ROOT</code> must point to xtc's directory.</li>

<li><code>CLASSPATH</code> must point to the <code>classes</code>
directory and the <code>junit.jar</code> and <code>javabdd.jar</code>
JAR files.</li>

<li><code>JAVA_HOME</code> must point to your Java installation.
<ul>
<li>On Mac OS X, it is <code>/Library/Java/Home</code>.</li>
<li>On Linux, it depends on Java's install location.  For example, on
Ubuntu running OpenJDK&nbsp;6, it
is <code>/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk</code>.</li>
</ul></li>

</ul></li>

<li>Source xtc's configuration script:
<pre>
source setup.sh
</pre>
or
<pre>
. setup.sh
</pre>
This makes the environment variable definitions visible in the current
shell.  You need to perform this step <em>every time</em> you start a
new shell, e.g., by opening a terminal window.
</li>

<li>Build xtc:
<pre>
make configure
make
make doc
</pre>
The first command configures xtc for your system's C compiler.  The
second command builds xtc's classes.  The third command builds xtc's
documentation (to be found in the <code>doc</code> subdirectory).
</li>

<li>Test xtc:
<pre>
make check
</pre>
If the command completes with
&ldquo;***&nbsp;Happy&nbsp;happy&nbsp;joy&nbsp;joy!&nbsp;***,&rdquo;
your are in great shape.</li>

<li>Start developing your own code:

<ul>

<li>Add a new package, say <code>the.package.name</code>, by creating
the <code>src/the/package/name</code> directory.</li>

<li>Copy the <a href="PackageMakefile.txt">make file template</a> into
that directory and rename it to <code>Makefile</code>.</li>

<li>Update the <code>Makefile</code> for your new package by changing
the definitions for <code>PACKAGE</code>, <code>PACKAGE_LOC</code>,
and <code>SOURCE</code>.</li>

<li>Add your new package to the <code>Makefile</code> in xtc's root
directory, i.e., by adding the package name to the list of
packages <code>PACKAGES</code>.</li>

</ul>

You are good to go.</li>

</ol>
