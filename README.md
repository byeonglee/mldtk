## Multi-Language Debugging Toolkit

Multi-language debugging toolkit (mldtk) is a collection of software tools derived from the xtc project at http://www.cs.nyu.edu/xtc. The main goal of this toolkit is to make it easy to test and debug the computer programs written in multiple programming languages. It includes a debugger for mixed-environment (Blink), a runtime error detector for foreign language interfaces, and a syntax and semantic error checker for processing macros in multiple languages (Marco). Its implementation works for Java and C/C++ while its design is programming language agnostic.
